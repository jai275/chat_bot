# Chatbot

## Problem statement

Create a program for the Second Chance Shelter for cats. This program will help match the customer and make the adoption process easier especially to those customers who could not go into the shelter.

Following the flow chart, I will create a chatbot that will ask a question and the user will answer. The chatbot will then ask another question based on the previous answer and will decide which profile will match the customer.

## Inputs, processes and outputs

Inputs: The user will answer questions accordingly.

Processes: Based on the users answers entered into the program, this will then choose which cat is available for adoption that is best suited to the answers the customer has entered.

Output: The output will be another question.
